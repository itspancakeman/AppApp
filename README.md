## GETTING STARTED

Feel free to follow this link to the live site --> [LiveSite]()
[Project Trello Board](https://trello.com/invite/b/66b2dade0b7795ee814e915b/ATTI83e542d4757008f05d9d6446d5fa443868D638EF/appapp)

To work on your local machine and view in the development server, go ahead and start by forking and cloning the repo into a directory of your choosing. After that ensure you have everything listed below installed, these are all the technologies you'll need
use the base application!

1. python3
2. pipenv
3. django
4. psycopg2-binary
5. (on your machine) Postgresql
6.  django_extensions
7.  IPython

after everything is installed you should be all set to `python3 manage.py runserver` and navigate to localhost:8000! 
Additionally, if you create a `superuser` using command `python manage.py createsuperuser` and filling out the questionare, you will be able to use Django's built in development server at localhost:8000/admin.

## What it do?

AppApp is a Python application that will allow users to find and share their favorite appetizer recipes. Complex database relationships allow users to create ingredients, recipes and ratings that all interconnect! This means that a user could find
all recipes connected to a specific ingredient, find recipes based on ratings, or get a full ingredient list for a recipe.

Full CRUD functionality will allow users to add, edit, and delete both ingredients and recipes. Visitors of the site will also be able to create both new users and ratings. 

All of the colored graphics I made in MS Pain with the help of icons from [TheNounProject](https://thenounproject.com), more specific credits with links can be found on the Trello board!

## Future Updates

Below is a list of features I'd like to work on adding in the near future, I will move these to a new *COMPLETED* section as I check them off.

1. User auth
2. user detail page where users can view their own recipes and ratings
3. a suggestor that recommends random items from the recipe list
4. filters for ingredient page that would allow you to select which ingredients you have to see if there are corresponding recipes
